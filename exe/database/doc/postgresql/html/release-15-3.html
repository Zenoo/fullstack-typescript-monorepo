      Within a <code class="command">CREATE SCHEMA</code> command, objects in the
      prevailing <code class="varname">search_path</code>, as well as those in the
      newly-created schema, would be visible even within a called

      Enforce row-level security policies correctly after inlining a

     </p><p>
      If a set-returning SQL-language function refers to a table having
      row-level security policies, and it can be inlined into a calling
      query, those RLS policies would not get enforced properly in some
      cases involving re-using a cached plan under a different role.
      This could allow a user to see or modify rows that should have been
      invisible.

      Fix the row count reported by <code class="command">MERGE</code> for some
      corner cases (Dean Rasheed)
     </p><p>
      The row count reported in the command tag counted rows that actually
      hadn't been modified due to a <code class="literal">BEFORE ROW</code> trigger
      returning NULL.  This is inconsistent with what happens in
      plain <code class="command">UPDATE</code> or <code class="command">DELETE</code>, so
      change it to not count such rows.  Also, avoid counting a row twice

      Fix <code class="command">MERGE</code> problems with concurrent updates

     </p><p>
      Some cases misbehaved if a row to be updated or deleted
      by <code class="command">MERGE</code> had just been updated by a concurrent
      transaction.  This could lead to a crash, or the wrong merge action
      being executed, or no action at all.

      Fix enabling/disabling of foreign-key triggers in partitioned tables

     </p><p>
      <code class="command">ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE/DISABLE TRIGGER</code> failed if
      applied to a partitioned table's foreign-key enforcement triggers,
      because it tried to locate the clone triggers for the partitions by
      name, and they do not have the same name.  Locate them by
      parent-trigger OID instead.

      Disallow altering composite types that are stored in indexes
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      <code class="command">ALTER TYPE</code> disallows non-binary-compatible
      modifications of composite types if they are stored in any table
      columns.  (Perhaps that will be allowed someday, but it hasn't
      happened yet; the locking implications of rewriting many tables are
      daunting.)  We overlooked the possibility that an index might
      contain a composite type that doesn't also appear in its table.

      Disallow system columns as elements of foreign keys (Tom Lane)

      Since the removal of OID as a system column, there is no plausible

      Disallow it rather than trying to fix all the cases.

      Ensure that <code class="command">COPY TO</code> from an RLS-enabled parent

      The documentation is quite clear that <code class="command">COPY TO</code>
      copies rows from only the named table, not any inheritance children
      it may have.  However, if row-level security was enabled on the table
      then this stopped being true.

      Re-allow exponential notation in ISO-8601 interval fields

      Interval input like <code class="literal">P0.1e10D</code> isn't officially

      Fix error cursor setting for parse errors in JSON string literals
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Most cases in which a syntax error is detected in a string literal
      within a JSON value failed to set the error cursor appropriately.
      This led at least to an unhelpful error message (pointing to the
      token before the string, rather than the actual trouble spot), and
      could even result in a crash in v14 and later.

      Fix data corruption due to <code class="varname">vacuum_defer_cleanup_age</code>

     </p><p>
      In v14 and later with non-default settings
      of <code class="varname">vacuum_defer_cleanup_age</code>, it was possible to
      compute a very large vacuum cleanup horizon xid, leading to vacuum
      removing rows that are still live.  v12 and v13 have a lesser form
      of the same problem affecting only GiST indexes, which could lead to

      Correctly update plan nodes' parallel-safety markings when moving

      This planner oversight could lead to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">subplan was not

      Avoid failure with PlaceHolderVars in extended-statistics code

     </p><p>
      A SubPlan within such a clause would cause assertion failures or

      Disable the inverse-transition optimization for window aggregates
      when the call contains sub-SELECTs (David Rowley)
     </p><p>
      This optimization requires that the aggregate's argument expressions

      Fix oversights in execution of nested <code class="literal">ARRAY[]</code>
      constructs (Alexander Lakhin, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Correctly detect overflow of the total space needed for the result
      array, avoiding a possible crash due to undersized output
      allocation.  Also ensure that any trailing padding space in the
      result array is zeroed; while leaving garbage there is harmless for
      most purposes, it can result in odd behavior later.

      (David Rowley)
     </p><p>
      Pruning with a condition like <code class="literal">boolcol IS NOT TRUE</code>
      was done incorrectly, leading to possibly not returning rows in
      which <code class="literal">boolcol</code> is NULL.  Also, the rather unlikely
      case of partitioning on <code class="literal">NOT boolcol</code> was handled
      incorrectly.

      Fix race condition in per-batch cleanup during parallel hash join

     </p><p>
      A crash was possible given unlucky timing and

      In <code class="literal">READ COMMITTED</code> isolation mode, the effects of
      a row update might need to get reapplied to a newer version of the

      Delay balancing is supposed to be disabled whenever autovacuum is

      Use of the syntax <code class="literal">INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET (c1,

      In the unusual case where the size of a large (&gt;8kB) palloc chunk
      is decreased, a Valgrind-aware build would mismark the defined-ness
      state of the memory released from the chunk, possibly causing
      incorrect results during Valgrind testing.

      Fix <span class="application">pg_dump</span> so that partitioned tables
      that are hash-partitioned on an enum-type column can be restored
      successfully (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      Since the hash codes for enum values depend on the OIDs assigned to
      the enum, they are typically different after a dump and restore,
      meaning that rows often need to go into a different partition than
      they were in originally.  Users can work around that by specifying
      the <code class="option">--load-via-partition-root</code> option; but since
      there is very little chance of success without that,
      teach <span class="application">pg_dump</span> to apply it automatically
      to such tables.
     </p><p>
      Also, fix <span class="application">pg_restore</span> to not try
      to <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> target tables before restoring into
      them when <code class="option">--load-via-partition-root</code> mode is used.
      This avoids a hazard of deadlocks and lost data.

      In cases of corruption we might see a wrapped-around 32-bit xid that
