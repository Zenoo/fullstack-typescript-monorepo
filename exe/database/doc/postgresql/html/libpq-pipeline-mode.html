   <span class="application">libpq</span> pipeline mode allows applications to
   send a query without having to read the result of the previously
   sent query.  Taking advantage of the pipeline mode, a client will wait
   less for the server, since multiple queries/results can be
   sent/received in a single network transaction.
  </p><p>
   While pipeline mode provides a significant performance boost, writing
   clients using the pipeline mode is more complex because it involves
   managing a queue of pending queries and finding which result
   corresponds to which query in the queue.
  </p><p>
   Pipeline mode also generally consumes more memory on both the client and server,
   though careful and aggressive management of the send/receive queue can mitigate
   this.  This applies whether or not the connection is in blocking or non-blocking
   mode.
  </p><p>
   While <span class="application">libpq</span>'s pipeline API was introduced in
   <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 14, it is a client-side feature
   which doesn't require special server support and works on any server
   that supports the v3 extended query protocol.  For more information see
   <a class="xref" href="protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-PIPELINING" title="55.2.4. Pipelining">Section 55.2.4</a>.
  </p><div class="sect2" id="LIBPQ-PIPELINE-USING"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">34.5.1. Using Pipeline Mode</h3></div></div></div><p>
    To issue pipelines, the application must switch the connection
    into pipeline mode,
    which is done with <a class="xref" href="libpq-pipeline-mode.html#LIBPQ-PQENTERPIPELINEMODE"><code class="function">PQenterPipelineMode</code></a>.
    <a class="xref" href="libpq-pipeline-mode.html#LIBPQ-PQPIPELINESTATUS"><code class="function">PQpipelineStatus</code></a> can be used
    to test whether pipeline mode is active.
    In pipeline mode, only <a class="link" href="libpq-async.html" title="34.4. Asynchronous Command Processing">asynchronous operations</a>
    that utilize the extended query protocol
    are permitted, command strings containing multiple SQL commands are
    disallowed, and so is <code class="literal">COPY</code>.
    Using synchronous command execution functions
    such as <code class="function">PQfn</code>,
    <code class="function">PQexec</code>,
    <code class="function">PQexecParams</code>,
    <code class="function">PQprepare</code>,
    <code class="function">PQexecPrepared</code>,
    <code class="function">PQdescribePrepared</code>,
    <code class="function">PQdescribePortal</code>,
    is an error condition.
    <code class="function">PQsendQuery</code> is
    also disallowed, because it uses the simple query protocol.
    Once all dispatched commands have had their results processed, and
    the end pipeline result has been consumed, the application may return
    to non-pipelined mode with <a class="xref" href="libpq-pipeline-mode.html#LIBPQ-PQEXITPIPELINEMODE"><code class="function">PQexitPipelineMode</code></a>.
   </p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
     It is best to use pipeline mode with <span class="application">libpq</span> in
     <a class="link" href="libpq-async.html#LIBPQ-PQSETNONBLOCKING">non-blocking mode</a>. If used
     in blocking mode it is possible for a client/server deadlock to occur.
      <a href="#ftn.id-1.7.3.12.9.3.1.3" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id-1.7.3.12.9.3.1.3">[15]</sup></a>

     After entering pipeline mode, the application dispatches requests using
     <a class="xref" href="libpq-async.html#LIBPQ-PQSENDQUERYPARAMS"><code class="function">PQsendQueryParams</code></a>
     or its prepared-query sibling
     <a class="xref" href="libpq-async.html#LIBPQ-PQSENDQUERYPREPARED"><code class="function">PQsendQueryPrepared</code></a>.
     These requests are queued on the client-side until flushed to the server;
     this occurs when <a class="xref" href="libpq-pipeline-mode.html#LIBPQ-PQPIPELINESYNC"><code class="function">PQpipelineSync</code></a> is used to
     establish a synchronization point in the pipeline,
     or when <a class="xref" href="libpq-async.html#LIBPQ-PQFLUSH"><code class="function">PQflush</code></a> is called.
     The functions <a class="xref" href="libpq-async.html#LIBPQ-PQSENDPREPARE"><code class="function">PQsendPrepare</code></a>,
     <a class="xref" href="libpq-async.html#LIBPQ-PQSENDDESCRIBEPREPARED"><code class="function">PQsendDescribePrepared</code></a>, and
     <a class="xref" href="libpq-async.html#LIBPQ-PQSENDDESCRIBEPORTAL"><code class="function">PQsendDescribePortal</code></a> also work in pipeline mode.
     Result processing is described below.
    </p><p>
     The server executes statements, and returns results, in the order the
     client sends them.  The server will begin executing the commands in the
     pipeline immediately, not waiting for the end of the pipeline.
     Note that results are buffered on the server side; the server flushes
     that buffer when a synchronization point is established with
     <code class="function">PQpipelineSync</code>, or when
     <code class="function">PQsendFlushRequest</code> is called.
     If any statement encounters an error, the server aborts the current
     transaction and does not execute any subsequent command in the queue
     until the next synchronization point;
     a <code class="literal">PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED</code> result is produced for
     each such command.
     (This remains true even if the commands in the pipeline would rollback
     the transaction.)
     Query processing resumes after the synchronization point.
    </p><p>
     It's fine for one operation to depend on the results of a
     prior one; for example, one query may define a table that the next
     query in the same pipeline uses. Similarly, an application may
     create a named prepared statement and execute it with later
     statements in the same pipeline.
    </p></div><div class="sect3" id="LIBPQ-PIPELINE-RESULTS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">34.5.1.2. Processing Results</h4></div></div></div><p>
     To process the result of one query in a pipeline, the application calls
     <code class="function">PQgetResult</code> repeatedly and handles each result
     until <code class="function">PQgetResult</code> returns null.
     The result from the next query in the pipeline may then be retrieved using
     <code class="function">PQgetResult</code> again and the cycle repeated.
     The application handles individual statement results as normal.
     When the results of all the queries in the pipeline have been
     returned, <code class="function">PQgetResult</code> returns a result
     containing the status value <code class="literal">PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC</code>
    </p><p>
     The client may choose to defer result processing until the complete
     pipeline has been sent, or interleave that with sending further
     queries in the pipeline; see <a class="xref" href="libpq-pipeline-mode.html#LIBPQ-PIPELINE-INTERLEAVE" title="34.5.1.4. Interleaving Result Processing and Query Dispatch">Section 34.5.1.4</a>.
    </p><p>
     To enter single-row mode, call <code class="function">PQsetSingleRowMode</code>
     before retrieving results with <code class="function">PQgetResult</code>.
     This mode selection is effective only for the query currently
     being processed. For more information on the use of
     <code class="function">PQsetSingleRowMode</code>,
     refer to <a class="xref" href="libpq-single-row-mode.html" title="34.6. Retrieving Query Results Row-by-Row">Section 34.6</a>.
    </p><p>
     <code class="function">PQgetResult</code> behaves the same as for normal
     asynchronous processing except that it may contain the new
     <code class="type">PGresult</code> types <code class="literal">PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC</code>
     and <code class="literal">PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED</code>.
     <code class="literal">PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC</code> is reported exactly once for each
     <code class="function">PQpipelineSync</code> at the corresponding point
     in the pipeline.
     <code class="literal">PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED</code> is emitted in place of a normal
     query result for the first error and all subsequent results
     until the next <code class="literal">PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC</code>;
     see <a class="xref" href="libpq-pipeline-mode.html#LIBPQ-PIPELINE-ERRORS" title="34.5.1.3. Error Handling">Section 34.5.1.3</a>.
    </p><p>
     <code class="function">PQisBusy</code>, <code class="function">PQconsumeInput</code>, etc
     operate as normal when processing pipeline results.  In particular,
     a call to <code class="function">PQisBusy</code> in the middle of a pipeline
     returns 0 if the results for all the queries issued so far have been
     consumed.
    </p><p>
     <span class="application">libpq</span> does not provide any information to the
     application about the query currently being processed (except that
     <code class="function">PQgetResult</code> returns null to indicate that we start
     returning the results of next query). The application must keep track
     of the order in which it sent queries, to associate them with their
     corresponding results.
     Applications will typically use a state machine or a FIFO queue for this.
    </p></div><div class="sect3" id="LIBPQ-PIPELINE-ERRORS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">34.5.1.3. Error Handling</h4></div></div></div><p>
     From the client's perspective, after <code class="function">PQresultStatus</code>
     returns <code class="literal">PGRES_FATAL_ERROR</code>,
     the pipeline is flagged as aborted.
     <code class="function">PQresultStatus</code> will report a
     <code class="literal">PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED</code> result for each remaining queued
     operation in an aborted pipeline. The result for
     <code class="function">PQpipelineSync</code> is reported as
     <code class="literal">PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC</code> to signal the end of the aborted pipeline
     and resumption of normal result processing.
    </p><p>
     The client <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> process results with
     <code class="function">PQgetResult</code> during error recovery.
    </p><p>
     If the pipeline used an implicit transaction, then operations that have
     already executed are rolled back and operations that were queued to follow
     the failed operation are skipped entirely. The same behavior holds if the
     pipeline starts and commits a single explicit transaction (i.e. the first
     statement is <code class="literal">BEGIN</code> and the last is
     <code class="literal">COMMIT</code>) except that the session remains in an aborted
     transaction state at the end of the pipeline. If a pipeline contains
     <span class="emphasis"><em>multiple explicit transactions</em></span>, all transactions that
     committed prior to the error remain committed, the currently in-progress
     transaction is aborted, and all subsequent operations are skipped completely,
     including subsequent transactions.  If a pipeline synchronization point
     occurs with an explicit transaction block in aborted state, the next pipeline
     will become aborted immediately unless the next command puts the transaction
     in normal mode with <code class="command">ROLLBACK</code>.
    </p><div class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
      The client must not assume that work is committed when it
      <span class="emphasis"><em>sends</em></span> a <code class="literal">COMMIT</code> — only when the
      corresponding result is received to confirm the commit is complete.
      Because errors arrive asynchronously, the application needs to be able to
      restart from the last <span class="emphasis"><em>received</em></span> committed change and
      resend work done after that point if something goes wrong.
     </p></div></div><div class="sect3" id="LIBPQ-PIPELINE-INTERLEAVE"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">34.5.1.4. Interleaving Result Processing and Query Dispatch</h4></div></div></div><p>
     To avoid deadlocks on large pipelines the client should be structured
     around a non-blocking event loop using operating system facilities
     such as <code class="function">select</code>, <code class="function">poll</code>,
     <code class="function">WaitForMultipleObjectEx</code>, etc.
    </p><p>
     The client application should generally maintain a queue of work
     remaining to be dispatched and a queue of work that has been dispatched
     but not yet had its results processed. When the socket is writable
     it should dispatch more work. When the socket is readable it should
     read results and process them, matching them up to the next entry in
     its corresponding results queue.  Based on available memory, results from the
     socket should be read frequently: there's no need to wait until the
     pipeline end to read the results.  Pipelines should be scoped to logical
     units of work, usually (but not necessarily) one transaction per pipeline.
     There's no need to exit pipeline mode and re-enter it between pipelines,
     or to wait for one pipeline to finish before sending the next.
    </p><p>
     An example using <code class="function">select()</code> and a simple state
     machine to track sent and received work is in
     <code class="filename">src/test/modules/libpq_pipeline/libpq_pipeline.c</code>
     in the PostgreSQL source distribution.

    Much like asynchronous query mode, there is no meaningful performance
    overhead when using pipeline mode. It increases client application complexity,
    and extra caution is required to prevent client/server deadlocks, but
    pipeline mode can offer considerable performance improvements, in exchange for
    increased memory usage from leaving state around longer.
   </p><p>
    Pipeline mode is most useful when the server is distant, i.e., network latency
    (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">ping time</span>”</span>) is high, and also when many small operations
    are being performed in rapid succession.  There is usually less benefit
    in using pipelined commands when each query takes many multiples of the client/server
    round-trip time to execute.  A 100-statement operation run on a server
    300 ms round-trip-time away would take 30 seconds in network latency alone
    without pipelining; with pipelining it may spend as little as 0.3 s waiting for
    results from the server.
   </p><p>
    Use pipelined commands when your application does lots of small
    <code class="literal">INSERT</code>, <code class="literal">UPDATE</code> and
    <code class="literal">DELETE</code> operations that can't easily be transformed
    into operations on sets, or into a <code class="literal">COPY</code> operation.
   </p><p>
    Pipeline mode is not useful when information from one operation is required by
    the client to produce the next operation. In such cases, the client
    would have to introduce a synchronization point and wait for a full client/server
    round-trip to get the results it needs. However, it's often possible to
    adjust the client design to exchange the required information server-side.
    Read-modify-write cycles are especially good candidates; for example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
BEGIN;
SELECT x FROM mytable WHERE id = 42 FOR UPDATE;
-- result: x=2
-- client adds 1 to x:
UPDATE mytable SET x = 3 WHERE id = 42;
COMMIT;
</pre><p>
    could be much more efficiently done with:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
UPDATE mytable SET x = x + 1 WHERE id = 42;
</pre><p>
   </p><p>
    Pipelining is less useful, and more complex, when a single pipeline contains
    multiple transactions (see <a class="xref" href="libpq-pipeline-mode.html#LIBPQ-PIPELINE-ERRORS" title="34.5.1.3. Error Handling">Section 34.5.1.3</a>).
   </p></div><div class="footnotes"><br /><hr style="width:100; text-align:left;margin-left: 0" /><div id="ftn.id-1.7.3.12.9.3.1.3" class="footnote"><p><a href="#id-1.7.3.12.9.3.1.3" class="para"><sup class="para">[15] </sup></a>
        The client will block trying to send queries to the server, but the
        server will block trying to send results to the client from queries
        it has already processed. This only occurs when the client sends
        enough queries to fill both its output buffer and the server's receive
