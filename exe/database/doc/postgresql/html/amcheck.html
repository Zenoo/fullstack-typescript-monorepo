  The <code class="filename">amcheck</code> module provides functions that allow you to
  verify the logical consistency of the structure of relations.
 </p><p>
  The B-Tree checking functions verify various <span class="emphasis"><em>invariants</em></span> in the
  structure of the representation of particular relations.  The
  correctness of the access method functions behind index scans and
  other important operations relies on these invariants always
  holding.  For example, certain functions verify, among other things,
  that all B-Tree pages have items in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">logical</span>”</span> order (e.g.,
  for B-Tree indexes on <code class="type">text</code>, index tuples should be in
  collated lexical order).  If that particular invariant somehow fails
  to hold, we can expect binary searches on the affected page to
  incorrectly guide index scans, resulting in wrong answers to SQL
  queries.  If the structure appears to be valid, no error is raised.
 </p><p>
  Verification is performed using the same procedures as those used by
  index scans themselves, which may be user-defined operator class
  code.  For example, B-Tree index verification relies on comparisons
  made with one or more B-Tree support function 1 routines.  See <a class="xref" href="xindex.html#XINDEX-SUPPORT" title="38.16.3. Index Method Support Routines">Section 38.16.3</a> for details of operator class support
  functions.
 </p><p>
  Unlike the B-Tree checking functions which report corruption by raising
  errors, the heap checking function <code class="function">verify_heapam</code> checks
  a table and attempts to return a set of rows, one row per corruption
  detected.  Despite this, if facilities that
  <code class="function">verify_heapam</code> relies upon are themselves corrupted, the
  function may be unable to continue and may instead raise an error.
 </p><p>
  Permission to execute <code class="filename">amcheck</code> functions may be granted
  to non-superusers, but before granting such permissions careful consideration
  should be given to data security and privacy concerns.  Although the
  corruption reports generated by these functions do not focus on the contents
  of the corrupted data so much as on the structure of that data and the nature
  of the corruptions found, an attacker who gains permission to execute these
  functions, particularly if the attacker can also induce corruption, might be
  able to infer something of the data itself from such messages.

      This example shows a session that performs verification of the
      10 largest catalog indexes in the database <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">test</span>”</span>.
      Verification of the presence of heap tuples as index tuples is
      requested for the subset that are unique indexes.  Since no
      error is raised, all indexes tested appear to be logically
      consistent.  Naturally, this query could easily be changed to
      call <code class="function">bt_index_check</code> for every index in the
      database where verification is supported.
     </p><p>
      <code class="function">bt_index_check</code> acquires an <code class="literal">AccessShareLock</code>
      on the target index and the heap relation it belongs to. This lock mode
      is the same lock mode acquired on relations by simple
      <code class="literal">SELECT</code> statements.
      <code class="function">bt_index_check</code> does not verify invariants
      that span child/parent relationships, but will verify the
      presence of all heap tuples as index tuples within the index
      when <em class="parameter"><code>heapallindexed</code></em> is
      <code class="literal">true</code>.  When a routine, lightweight test for
      corruption is required in a live production environment, using
      <code class="function">bt_index_check</code> often provides the best
      trade-off between thoroughness of verification and limiting the
      impact on application performance and availability.

      <code class="function">bt_index_parent_check</code> tests that its
      target, a B-Tree index, respects a variety of invariants.
      Optionally, when the <em class="parameter"><code>heapallindexed</code></em>
      argument is <code class="literal">true</code>, the function verifies the
      presence of all heap tuples that should be found within the
      index.  When the optional <em class="parameter"><code>rootdescend</code></em>
      argument is <code class="literal">true</code>, verification re-finds
      tuples on the leaf level by performing a new search from the
      root page for each tuple.  The checks that can be performed by
      <code class="function">bt_index_parent_check</code> are a superset of the
      checks that can be performed by <code class="function">bt_index_check</code>.
      <code class="function">bt_index_parent_check</code> can be thought of as
      a more thorough variant of <code class="function">bt_index_check</code>:
      unlike <code class="function">bt_index_check</code>,
      <code class="function">bt_index_parent_check</code> also checks
      invariants that span parent/child relationships, including checking
      that there are no missing downlinks in the index structure.
      <code class="function">bt_index_parent_check</code> follows the general
      convention of raising an error if it finds a logical
      inconsistency or other problem.
     </p><p>
      A <code class="literal">ShareLock</code> is required on the target index by
      <code class="function">bt_index_parent_check</code> (a
      <code class="literal">ShareLock</code> is also acquired on the heap relation).
      These locks prevent concurrent data modification from
      <code class="command">INSERT</code>, <code class="command">UPDATE</code>, and <code class="command">DELETE</code>
      commands.  The locks also prevent the underlying relation from
      being concurrently processed by <code class="command">VACUUM</code>, as well as
      all other utility commands.  Note that the function holds locks
      only while running, not for the entire transaction.
     </p><p>
      <code class="function">bt_index_parent_check</code>'s additional
      verification is more likely to detect various pathological
      cases.  These cases may involve an incorrectly implemented
      B-Tree operator class used by the index that is checked, or,
      hypothetically, undiscovered bugs in the underlying B-Tree index
      access method code.  Note that
      <code class="function">bt_index_parent_check</code> cannot be used when
      hot standby mode is enabled (i.e., on read-only physical
      replicas), unlike <code class="function">bt_index_check</code>.

  When the <em class="parameter"><code>heapallindexed</code></em> argument to B-Tree
  verification functions is <code class="literal">true</code>, an additional
  phase of verification is performed against the table associated with
  the target index relation.  This consists of a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dummy</span>”</span>
  <code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code> operation, which checks for the
  presence of all hypothetical new index tuples against a temporary,
  in-memory summarizing structure (this is built when needed during
  the basic first phase of verification).  The summarizing structure
  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fingerprints</span>”</span> every tuple found within the target
  index.  The high level principle behind
  <em class="parameter"><code>heapallindexed</code></em> verification is that a new
  index that is equivalent to the existing, target index must only
  have entries that can be found in the existing structure.
 </p><p>
  The additional <em class="parameter"><code>heapallindexed</code></em> phase adds
  significant overhead: verification will typically take several times
  longer.  However, there is no change to the relation-level locks
  acquired when <em class="parameter"><code>heapallindexed</code></em> verification is
  performed.
 </p><p>
  The summarizing structure is bound in size by
  <code class="varname">maintenance_work_mem</code>.  In order to ensure that
  there is no more than a 2% probability of failure to detect an
  inconsistency for each heap tuple that should be represented in the
  index, approximately 2 bytes of memory are needed per tuple.  As
  less memory is made available per tuple, the probability of missing
  an inconsistency slowly increases.  This approach limits the
  overhead of verification significantly, while only slightly reducing
  the probability of detecting a problem, especially for installations
  where verification is treated as a routine maintenance task.  Any
  single absent or malformed tuple has a new opportunity to be
  detected with each new verification attempt.

     Structural inconsistencies caused by incorrect operator class
     implementations.
    </p><p>
     This includes issues caused by the comparison rules of operating
     system collations changing. Comparisons of datums of a collatable
     type like <code class="type">text</code> must be immutable (just as all
     comparisons used for B-Tree index scans must be immutable), which
     implies that operating system collation rules must never change.
     Though rare, updates to operating system collation rules can
     cause these issues. More commonly, an inconsistency in the
     collation order between a primary server and a standby server is
     implicated, possibly because the <span class="emphasis"><em>major</em></span> operating
     system version in use is inconsistent.  Such inconsistencies will
     generally only arise on standby servers, and so can generally
     only be detected on standby servers.
    </p><p>
     If a problem like this arises, it may not affect each individual
     index that is ordered using an affected collation, simply because
     <span class="emphasis"><em>indexed</em></span> values might happen to have the same
     absolute ordering regardless of the behavioral inconsistency. See
     <a class="xref" href="locale.html" title="24.1. Locale Support">Section 24.1</a> and <a class="xref" href="collation.html" title="24.2. Collation Support">Section 24.2</a> for

     Note that <code class="filename">amcheck</code> examines a page as represented in some

     shared buffer hit when accessing the block. Consequently,
     <code class="filename">amcheck</code> does not necessarily examine data read from the

     Corruption caused by faulty RAM, or the broader memory subsystem.
    </p><p>
     <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> does not protect against correctable

    </p><p>
     When <em class="parameter"><code>heapallindexed</code></em> verification is

  Structural corruption can happen due to faulty storage hardware, or
  relation files being overwritten or modified by unrelated software.
  This kind of corruption can also be detected with
  <a class="link" href="checksums.html" title="30.2. Data Checksums"><span class="application">data page
  checksums</span></a>.
 </p><p>
  Relation pages which are correctly formatted, internally consistent, and
  correct relative to their own internal checksums may still contain
  logical corruption.  As such, this kind of corruption cannot be detected
  with <span class="application">checksums</span>.  Examples include toasted
  values in the main table which lack a corresponding entry in the toast
  table, and tuples in the main table with a Transaction ID that is older
  than the oldest valid Transaction ID in the database or cluster.
 </p><p>
  Multiple causes of logical corruption have been observed in production
  systems, including bugs in the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>
  server software, faulty and ill-conceived backup and restore tools, and
  user error.
 </p><p>
  Corrupt relations are most concerning in live production environments,
  precisely the same environments where high risk activities are least
  welcome.  For this reason, <code class="function">verify_heapam</code> has been
  designed to diagnose corruption without undue risk.  It cannot guard
  against all causes of backend crashes, as even executing the calling
  query could be unsafe on a badly corrupted system.   Access to <a class="link" href="catalogs-overview.html" title="53.1. Overview">catalog tables</a> is performed and could
  be problematic if the catalogs themselves are corrupted.

  errors in the event of conditions that, by definition, should never
  happen, and so careful analysis of <code class="filename">amcheck</code>
  errors is often required.
 </p><p>
  There is no general method of repairing problems that
  <code class="filename">amcheck</code> detects.  An explanation for the root cause of
  an invariant violation should be sought.  <a class="xref" href="pageinspect.html" title="F.25. pageinspect">pageinspect</a> may play a useful role in diagnosing
  corruption that <code class="filename">amcheck</code> detects.  A <code class="command">REINDEX</code>
  may not be effective in repairing corruption.
