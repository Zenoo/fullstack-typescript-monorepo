      <span class="application">libpq</span> can leak memory contents after
      GSSAPI transport encryption initiation fails (Jacob Champion)
     </p><p>
      A modified server, or an unauthenticated man-in-the-middle, can
      send a not-zero-terminated error message during setup of GSSAPI
      (Kerberos) transport encryption.  <span class="application">libpq</span>
      will then copy that string, as well as following bytes in
      application memory up to the next zero byte, to its error report.
      Depending on what the calling application does with the error
      report, this could result in disclosure of application memory
      contents.  There is also a small probability of a crash due to
      reading beyond the end of memory.  Fix by properly zero-terminating
      the server message.

      Fix handling of pending inserts when doing a bulk insertion to a

      In some cases pending insertions were not flushed to the FDW soon
      enough, leading to logical inconsistencies, for

      Allow <code class="literal">REPLICA IDENTITY</code>

     </p><p>
      When <span class="application">pg_dump</span> dumps a partitioned index
      that's marked <code class="literal">REPLICA IDENTITY</code>, it generates a
      command sequence that applies <code class="literal">REPLICA IDENTITY</code>
      before the partitioned index has been marked valid, causing restore
      to fail.  There seems no very good reason to prohibit doing it in
      that order, so allow it.  The marking will have no effect anyway
      until the index becomes valid.

     </p><p>
      In some cases a <code class="literal">DEFAULT</code> marker would not get

      Reject uses of undefined variables in <code class="type">jsonpath</code>
      existence checks (Alexander Korotkov, David G. Johnston)
     </p><p>
      While <code class="type">jsonpath</code> match operators threw an error for an
      undefined variable in the path pattern, the existence operators
      silently treated it as a match.

      Fix <code class="type">jsonb</code> subscripting to cope with toasted subscript

     </p><p>
      Using a text value fetched directly from a table as
      a <code class="type">jsonb</code> subscript was likely to fail.
      Fetches would usually not find any matching element.
      Assignments could store the value with a garbage key,
      although keys long enough to cause that problem are probably rare in
      the field.

      Fix edge-case data corruption in parallel hash joins (Dmitry Astapov)
     </p><p>
      If the final chunk of a large tuple being written out to a temporary
      file was exactly 32760 bytes, it would be corrupted due to a
      fencepost bug.  The query would typically fail later with
      corrupted-data symptoms.

      Correctly report a short read, giving the numbers of bytes desired

      Remove arbitrary limit on number of elements

     </p><p>
      The input functions for these types previously rejected more than
      100 elements.  With the introduction of the logical replication
      column list feature, it's necessary to
      accept <code class="type">int2vector</code>s having up to 1600 columns,
      otherwise long column lists cause logical-replication failures.

      If there's not been an explicit <code class="command">BEGIN

      Reject cancel request packets having the wrong length
      (Andrey Borodin)
     </p><p>
      The server would process a cancel request even if its length word
      was too small.  This led to reading beyond the end of the allocated
      buffer.  In theory that could cause a segfault, but it seems quite
      unlikely to happen in practice, since the buffer would have to be
      very close to the end of memory.  The more likely outcome was a bogus
      log message about wrong backend PID or cancel code.  Complain about
      the wrong length, instead.

      Fix planner preprocessing oversights for window function run-condition
      expressions (Richard Guo, David Rowley)
     </p><p>

     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix possible dangling-pointer access during execution of window
      function run-condition expressions (David Rowley)
     </p><p>
      In practice, because the run-condition optimization is only applied
      to certain window functions that happen to all
      return <code class="type">int8</code>, this only manifested as a problem on
      32-bit builds.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Add recursion and looping defenses in subquery pullup (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      A contrived query can result in deep recursion and unreasonable
      amounts of time spent trying to flatten subqueries.  A proper fix
      for that seems unduly invasive for a back-patch, but we can at least
      add stack depth checks and an interrupt check to allow the query to
      be cancelled.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix planner issues when combining Memoize nodes with partitionwise
      joins or parameterized nestloops (Richard Guo)
     </p><p>
      These errors could lead to not using Memoize in contexts where it
      would be useful, or possibly to wrong query plans.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Fix partitionwise-join code to tolerate failure to produce a plan for
      each partition (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      This could result in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">could not devise a query plan for the

      Limit the amount of cleanup work done
      by <code class="function">get_actual_variable_range</code> (Simon Riggs)
     </p><p>
      Planner runs occurring just after deletion of a large number of
      tuples appearing at the end of an index could expend significant
      amounts of work setting the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">killed</span>”</span> bits for those
      index entries.  Limit the amount of work done in any one query by
      giving up on this process after examining 100 heap pages.  All the
      cleanup will still happen eventually, but without so large a
      performance hiccup.

      Prevent the statistics machinery from getting confused when a

      Fix under-parenthesized display of <code class="literal">AT TIME ZONE</code>
      constructs (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>
      This could result in dump/restore failures for rules or views in

      Prevent clobbering of cached parsetrees for utility statements in
      SQL functions (Tom Lane, Daniel Gustafsson)
     </p><p>
      If a SQL-language function executes the same utility command more

      Fix deadlock between <code class="command">DROP DATABASE</code> and logical
      replication worker process (Hou Zhijie)
     </p><p>
      This was caused by an ill-advised choice to block interrupts while
      creating a logical replication slot in the worker.  In version 15
      that could lead to an undetected deadlock.  In version 14, no
      deadlock has been observed, but it's still a bad idea to block
      interrupts while waiting for network I/O.

      Clean up the <span class="application">libpq</span> connection object
      after a failed replication connection attempt (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>
      The previous coding leaked the connection object.  In background
      code paths that's pretty harmless because the calling process will
      give up and exit.  But in commands such as <code class="command">CREATE
      SUBSCRIPTION</code>, such a failure resulted in a small
      session-lifespan memory leak.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      In hot-standby servers, reduce processing effort for tracking XIDs
      known to be active on the primary (Simon Riggs, Michail Nikolaev)
     </p><p>
      Insufficiently-aggressive cleanup of the KnownAssignedXids array
      could lead to poor performance, particularly
      when <code class="varname">max_connections</code> is set to a large value on
      the standby.

      Ignore invalidated logical-replication slots while determining
      oldest catalog xmin (Sirisha Chamarthi)
     </p><p>
      A replication slot could prevent cleanup of dead tuples in the
      system catalogs even after it becomes invalidated due to
      exceeding <code class="varname">max_slot_wal_keep_size</code>.  Thus, failure
      of a replication consumer could lead to indefinitely-large catalog
      bloat.

      In logical decoding, notify the remote node when a transaction is
      detected to have crashed (Hou Zhijie)
     </p><p>
      After a server restart, we'll re-stream the changes for transactions
      occurring shortly before the restart.  Some of these transactions
      probably never completed; when we realize that one didn't we throw
      away the relevant decoding state locally, but we neglected to tell
      the subscriber about it.  That led to the subscriber keeping useless
      streaming files until it's next restarted.

      Fix uninitialized-memory usage in logical decoding (Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>
      In certain cases, resumption of logical decoding could try to re-use

      behavior.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Acquire spinlock while updating shared state during logical decoding
      context creation (Masahiko Sawada)

      Fix <span class="application">pgoutput</span> replication plug-in to not

      (Hou Zhijie)
     </p><p>
      <code class="literal">UPDATE</code> and <code class="literal">DELETE</code> events did
      not pay attention to the configured column list, thus sending more
      data than expected.  This did not cause a problem when the receiver
      is our built-in logical replication code, but it might confuse other
      receivers, and in any case it wasted network bandwidth.

      Failure to do this left the page possibly different on standby
